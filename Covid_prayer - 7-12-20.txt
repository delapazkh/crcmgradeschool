Father God, thank you for this another wonderful opportunity to live life and serve you.
We praise you and glorify your name. Lord God I am reaching out to you today to ask for you strength, guidance
and wisdom as we face this pandemic. I pray that you continue to bless our family and friends
with good health. Lord God I pray that you stay with my father as he is currently recovering from this
covid disease. I know that you have always been there for my family and I know that you will still be there.
I declare healing for him lord God. You have kept him safe all this time from harm and I know that that will never change. 

I also pray for others who are recovering oh lord. Lord Jesus, During your stay here on earth, you have healed people of
all ages and all illness. Please be present now and guide the doctors and nurses taking care of them. Please take away thier
fear, and anxiety and protect thier families from harm.

You are the source of our spiritual strength oh God, that's how i know we will win this battle. Whatever is happening now, i know that you
have a better plan for us. Let your will be done. All this we ask in Jesus' name. Ame
